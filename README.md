# JupyShare

JupyShare lets you release your notebook to the cloud and gives you a public endpoint for it through ngrok.

### Motivation
JupyShare is perfect for two things
1.  For freeing you up from the huge hassle of trying to debug jupyter notebooks with friends by taking screenshots or copy pasting.
2.  For showing something cool to a friend without having to tell them to download your masterpiece:

### Prerequisites

```
brew cask install ngrok

pip install jupyshare
